6. **ISLE update:**
  > From David Keiser-Clark:
   * August 31 60 of 84 in pledges committed
     * Need 4 x 4k pledges to hit target fundraising goal. (model is 4k pledges)
     * Reminder that an actual check is not needed at moment just a pledge.
     * 3 schools in process of making pitches to CIO/stakeholders recommending ISLE
   * ISLE Question from UPITT:
     * Gearman boxes as docker instances?
     * Currently have challenges in production
     * islandora_jobs works with gearman
     * fast ingestion offload from main box
     * seems like this would be good idea to incorporate in sprint

7. **Bugs Issues:**

  Brian Gillingham mentioned two recent pull requests.

  > To address an issue I noticed when running OCR on many books.  The OCR process could fail if the OCR datastream provided was either empty or contained a single character “0” (unlikely, but still possible I supposed).  Since PHP can interpret an empty string or a “0” as a false, when using file_get_contents, the result must be checked that it is not === FALSE to say it truly failed.  It is described here https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/ISLANDORA-2026
https://github.com/Islandora/islandora_paged_content/pull/135 .  (It looks like I need to ping Jared Whiklo to see if he is making that suggested change or if I am).

  > The JP2 issue, listed here https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/ISLANDORA-2042 pertains to a problem we noticed when ingesting TIF files that we had outsourced to 3rd party.  Those TIF files were actually scanned with 1-bit depth.

  > I added an option to the large image solution pack for “Convert source to RGB 8 bit prior to creating JP2 datastreams” and the corresponding code to the includes/derivatives.inc "islandora_large_image_create_jp2_derivative" function.  This has been merged to 7.x-1.x as https://github.com/Islandora/islandora_solution_pack_large_image/commit/92a844ffb54ffb69445a4a8eaf99a7490e8dd5df in this pull https://github.com/Islandora/islandora_solution_pack_large_image/pull/169.

8. **Roundtable**

Apologies, team. Notes are not great. Email me to fix if warranted.

Brian G. - UPITT

> Things are calming down. The ingest confusion of setting up content types is behind him now. Identifying and fleshing out errors. Lot of places that batch ingest can stop or error and not always in a good location or not in watch dog. In fact, error logs missing. A list of logs would be helpful. Batch ingest processing can fill up disk space, 100GB in a couple of days. Also while derivatives are created in temp directory, batch process is not exiting properly. Curious if others have run into similar issues. Would love to code specify temp swap space used by process.

> Still in pre prod / beta on collections. Signing contrib agreements. (links?)
	Picked up whole lot of Ansible stuff using beta servers and vagrant etc. Using Centos/ RHEL VMs in prod. Shares setup process below.

> Using Drupal 8 yaml files and	working towards config/ export when 7.x.10 comes out and can add to repo.
