## Notes from the call

Notes are a bit choppy due to Google Hangouts not preserving chat posts but the resulting discussions were fantastic.

1. Bryan Gilligan with Clinton G. (UPitt) reporting on issues with their SOLR index. Involved discussion / changes on Java runtime config. (If this could be posted somewhere for others, that'd be grand!) Additionally, there is most likely a JIRA ticket to be posted to this effect?

1. Bryan G. and Clinton G. (UPitt) attempting a workflow ingest overarching "thing" with researching general Drupal modules e.g. rules to accomplish this.
    * https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/ISLANDORA712/Chapter+9+-+About+the+Islandora+Rule+Engine

    * https://github.com/Islandora/islandora/wiki/Working-with-Drupal-Rules (*unsure how widely distributed this is*)

1. Bryan Brown Learning Docker

1. Ed Fugikawa is interested in Kubernetes and also suggested the following:

  * https://github.com/jefferyb/islandora-7.x-docker (*working on docker*)

  * https://github.com/jefferyb/islandora-7.x-enterprise-ansible

1. Discussion about how Ansible and Docker "play together" and the benefits of using Ansible over Dockerfile shell scripts.			

1. Bryan BrownEd: "We're using CentOS Atomic Hosts in our dev VM to see how far we get."

  * https://www.projectatomic.io/

1. Brad Spry:
  * Was just immersed in a "server-less" (Lambda) computing session and training seminar and is also focused on Docker on Amazon Web Services.

  * Working on hard on book batch to be used for manuscripts.

  * Working on a Islandora "Drag n drop" from local NAS to cloud. There are currently Islandora drag and drop scripts out there but will be updating soon. https://github.com/unc-charlotte-libraries/islandora_ingest_dragndrop
  Not using manuscript solution pack, using book batch instead. Probably should. (Clinton's suggestion) ties finding aid and manuscript.

  **Quote:** *"If ArchiveSpace had a OAI module which it doesn't. It's 2016 we want integrated systems with MODS and EAD."*

  **Followup:** Mark Jordan attended a conference with Jonathan Green and Mark Cooper of Lyrasis, who were discussing such an integration, though it is unclear what the progress is.

1. Discussion on replacing Triplestore (mulgara) after a million objects.

  * PITT running on Blazegraph (GPU).

  * Brad S. feels like the replacement is a necessity e.g. handling collections within collections.

  * Discoverygarden is an authority on this and shares information about their replacement Trippi-Sail. http://www.discoverygarden.ca/blog/2016/7/27/introducing-the-trippi-sail-triplestore-adapter

1. Mark Jordan has been working on more production tooling and MIK (Move to islandora kit.)

  * https://github.com/mjordan/iipqa Creates packages e.g. MIK or manually, run this on it to validate and not get any surprises.

  * http://digital.lib.sfu.ca is his organization that utilizes this tool with large newspaper collections to solve scalability issues.

  *	Don't use scaled tesseract? Already had OCR from ArchiveSpace. (Duraspace)
    * Mark got into this https://github.com/mjordan/islandora_background_process
    * Implementation of that: https://github.com/mjordan/islandora_bprocess_ocr
    * https://github.com/mjordan/ocr_rest give an image
    * Finally non-islandora implementation
      * Distributed OCR https://github.com/mjordan/docr-smd can run client on Android (not related docker)
    	 * mobile devices could be servers with python client or raspberry pis
    	 * finds a client to do the ocr
    	 * proof of concept - setup server with http & 4 clients
       * Can train Tesseract - but removing bottleneck (slowest part of stock) - fewer derivatives - wanting to do pre-derivatives?

1. **TO DO FOR GROUP**:

  * Curation of all shared URLs from meeting notes every 2-3 months and add to the "Islandora Awesome list?" as well as on Github page?
  * Goal is to have better documentation.
  * Migrations was topic of last meeting.
  * Additional documentation ideas / topics:
    * Migration
    * Tuning
    * Scaling
    * SOLR
    * Tesseract
    * Workflows			
    * Pre-deratives
    *	AWS transcoding service & imaging
      * Brad S. has an idea for running this as a service?
    * Add more here please:https://github.com/islandora-interest-groups/Islandora-DevOps-Interest-Group/blob/main/automation.md

  **GOAL**

    * Set up sprint towards January on the topic of migration process.
    * An email / Google group post to be send out in January lays out the sprints / goal.
1. Last minute discussion and agreement to continue using Google Hangouts as the primary means of communication. Link to always be posted in Agenda.
