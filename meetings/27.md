## Notes
1. [Issue 45 in DevOps IG queue: "Evaluate DevOps interest and needs to increase participation"](https://github.com/islandora-interest-groups/Islandora-DevOps-Interest-Group/issues/45)
    - Revising the DOIG charge could help gather new membership
    - Involvement in Islandoracon has been successful in the past, we should continue this effort
    - Perhaps there are ways to include DevOps info in Islandora Camps?
    - Melissa & Gavin will draft language to be posted to the Islandora list in an attempt to drum up membership
    - Also might draft a survey for ex-members to see why they left and what they would want in order to return

2. ISLE Updates
    - ISLE is moving into the alpha testing stage
    - Test sites take pre-existing data and configurations & migrate these into an ISLE instance
    - Grinnell & Washington College are the first testers, more to follow and looking for volunteers
    
3. Listserv Post about Installation Documentation
    - URL: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/islandora/YamWzunQZsM
    - DevOps IG doesn't understand the context, the specified variables don't seem to exist in their instances
    - Melissa mentions that the referred to documentation is likely 3 years old and far out of date
    - Gavin will respond to listserv post seeking clarification and possibly update the documentation
    
4. IR IG Update
    - IR IG has been looking at the COAR Next Generation Repositories report, and looking to synthesize recommendations for the Islandora Foundation
    
5. Group Projects
    - Likely best to pause on this until we have more members.
     
6. Roundtable
    - Melissa will be going on maternity leave, reach out to Danny if you have questions/updates
    - Clinton mentions that Djatoka's inefficiencies might be a good group project for DevOps IG
        - Gavin suggests Clinton add this to the DevOps org issue queue to chew on later.
