# Islandora DevOps Interest Group

As of April 2018, this group is taking an **indefinite hiatus** from having online meetings. 

For those interested within the Islandora community wanting to start up the monthly online meetings, please contact Melissa Anez at the Islandora Foundation directly for steps on how to do that. 

Please note: This doesn't impact any other projects, discussions, deployment guides or ongoing development of the islandora vagrant box. 

## Convenors

The last two convenors were: 
* [Bryan J. Brown](https://github.com/bryjbrown) (Florida State University)
* [Gavin Morris](https://github.com/g7morris) (Born-Digital, Common Media Inc.)

## How to participate

There is an online meeting held every second Wednesday of the month at 11:00 AM-noon PST / 2:00-3:00 PM EST.

Join by visiting this [Google Hangouts](https://hangouts.google.com/hangouts/_/commonmediainc.com/islandor-devops) URL.
